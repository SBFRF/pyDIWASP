try to minimize dependencies (especially those that require licesnes). dont add new packages with out asking me first. 
look for modular code, break tasks out to functions. 
break similar functikns to libraries
prefer data classes to dictionaries. 
always run tests before commiting, ensure they run before commiting. if they break, fix before comitting.
Dont take shortcuts, make sure things work.
after a commit and basic functionality validated, re-examine and try to do it in less lines.
